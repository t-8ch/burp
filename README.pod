=head1 NAME

burp - an AUR uploader

=head1 SYNOPSIS

I<burp> [options] packages...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

burp is a simple tool to upload packages to the AUR. It is written in C and
only depends on libcurl for its functionality.

Invoking burp consists of supplying any applicable options and one or more
packages. Packages are tarballs generated by makepkg's --source operation.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over

=item B<-u> I<USER>B<, --user=>I<USER>

AUR login username. If omitted and not specified in the config file, you will be
prompted to enter this at runtime.

=item B<-p> I<PASSWORD>B<, --password=>I<PASSWORD>B< >

AUR login password. If omitted and not specified in the config file, you will be
prompted to enter this at runtime.

=item B<-c> I<CAT>B<, --category=>I<CAT>

Specify I<CAT> to assign to uploaded packages. This should only be specified once.
If specified multiple times, the last will take precedence. If this option is not
specified, the category will default to type 'None' for new taurballs and the current
category for updated taurballs. A list of valid categories can be obtained by invoking
the -c flag with 'help'.

=item B<-C> I<FILE>B<, --cookies=>I<FILE>

I<FILE> is the path in which to store cookies instead of the default temporary
file. If this file exists and is in valid Netscape cookie file format, login to
the AUR will be attempted using these cookies. Also see the -k option.

=item B<-k, --keep-cookies>

Cookies will be persistent and reused for logins. If you specify this option, you must
also provide a cookie file path with the -C option or in the config file.

=item B<-v, --verbose>

Be more verbose. Pass this option twice to see debug info.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

burp will look for a config file located at I<$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/burp/burp.conf>
and read default options from it in key=value format. Valid keys are:

=begin man

.sp
.RS 4
.nf
.BB lightgray
User      = \fIUSER\fR
Password  = \fIPASSWORD\fR
Cookies   = \fIFILE\fR
Persist
.EB lightgray
.fi
.RE

=end man

=begin html

<dd>
User      = <i>USER</i><br/>
Password  = <i>PASSWORD</i><br/>
Cookies   = <i>FILE</i><br/>
Persist<br/>
</dd>

=end html

These should all be self explanatory. Comments, if desired, can be specified
by starting a line with a #.  Command line options will always take precedence
over options specified in the config file.
